•	Start
•	Get the input program from the file prog.txt.
•	Read the program line by line and check if each word in a line is a keyword, identifier, constant or an operator.
•	If the word read is an identifier, assign a number to the identifier and make an entry into the symbol table stored in sybol.txt.
•	For each lexeme read, generate a token as follows:
a.	If the lexeme is an identifier, then the token generated is of the form
<id, number>
b.		If the lexeme is an operator, then the token generated is <op, operator>.
c.	If the lexeme is a constant, then the token generated is <const, value>.
d.	If the lexeme is a keyword, then the token is the keyword itself.
•	The stream of tokens generated are displayed in the console output.
•	Stop.
